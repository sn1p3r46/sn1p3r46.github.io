Why? 
---------	

This little space born from the idea of share my new 
knowledeges, solved issues, and projects with the whole internet community,
let's introduce my self:


>I am an 22 years old Italian CS student,
more precisely I am undergraduate, attending 
last year at university of Perugia. 

I love Linux and OpenSource at all.
My favourite distros are:

* Fedora
* Crunchbang
* Ubuntu
